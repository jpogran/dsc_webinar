## Setup

Run `vagrant up` to start the VM for the demos. Vagrant will download the VM and provision it with what is needed to run the demos.

## Running the Demos

Inside the VM run:

- `puppet apply c:\vagrant\notify_service.pp`
- `puppet apply c:\vagrant\iis.pp`

If you are having trouble running puppet, check that the PATH is set correctly.
